                                    The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands
                                    grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls, that
                                    stretch along a length of 871 kilometres
                                    north to south, 130 kilometres east to west,
                                    spread over roughly 90,000 square
                                    kilometres, of which only 298 km2 is dry
                                    land, making this one of the world's most
                                    dispersed countries. The atolls are composed
                                    of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated
                                    atop a submarine ridge 960 kilometres long
                                    that rises abruptly from the depths of the
                                    Indian Ocean and runs north to south.
